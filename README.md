This project develops an automated sales dashboard for ATLIQ Software, a leading computer hardware manufacturer. It addresses inconsistencies in sales reporting and reduces manual processes using Power BI, Excel, and MySQL. The dashboard transforms raw sales data into real-time, actionable insights, enabling the sales team to make informed, data-driven decisions.


## Problem Statement
